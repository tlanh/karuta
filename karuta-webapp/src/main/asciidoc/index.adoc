:toc-title: Available endpoints
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

This document describes all the available endpoints that the Karuta backend
provides. Apart from the sign-in endpoint, every single other endpoint
requires the user to be authenticated to authorize a request.

This means that you need to provide the cookie containing the attached session
in every single request you make.

If you are using `curl`, this means that you need to use the `-b` option first
when you reach the login endpoint and then use the `-c` option passing the
path to the file previously generated with `-b`.

Apart from **few ones**, most endpoints can consume or produce either XML or
JSON. By default, XML is implied but you can specify the `Accept` or
`Content-Type` headers to deal with JSON requests and responses.
