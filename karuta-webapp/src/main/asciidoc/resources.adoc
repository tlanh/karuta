=== GET /resource/file/{id}

This endpoint returns a file held by a resource.

[NOTE]
The `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` headers are based on the
resource's `type` and `filename` tags. Here, for documentation purposes,
a text response is exposed.

[NOTE]
You can pass a `lang` parameter to get the resource's file for a specific
locale; by default `fr` is implied. This parameter is used to compute the
aforementioned headers.
